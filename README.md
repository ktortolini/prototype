# Experiential Prototype

## ðŸ“œ _Description_

Just as a personal showcase, this repository will contain a portfolio of digital art crafted with `p5.js`, underpinned by the `Deno Runtime` using `JS(ES6)` and `TS(5.3)` files. Its objective is to archive digital artistry and demonstrate my creative abilities, alongside a passion for creating modern digital assets.

## ðŸ”¥ _Usage Information_

Currently, the canvas displays a singular dark space within the viewport of the Browser, that may be changed with the user clicking and interacting with the empty canvas. Each click will add a unique blob of colorful dots to the canvas, and each dot has a color property that slightly changes from one iteration to the next using a gradient.
